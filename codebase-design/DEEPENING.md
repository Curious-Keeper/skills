# Deepening

How to deepen a cluster of shallow modules safely, given its dependencies. Assumes the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**.

## Dependency categories

When assessing a candidate for deepening, classify its dependencies. The category determines how the deepened module is tested across its seam.

### 1. In-process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable: merge the modules and test through the new interface directly. No adapter needed.

### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. The deepened module is tested with the stand-in running in the test suite. The seam is internal; no port at the module's external interface.

### 3. Remote but owned (Ports & Adapters)

Your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** (interface) at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP/gRPC/queue adapter.

Recommendation shape: _"Define a port at the seam, implement an HTTP adapter for production and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it's deployed across a network."_

### 4. True external (Mock)

Third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) you don't control. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Seam discipline

- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a port unless at least two adapters are justified (typically production + test). A single-adapter seam is just indirection.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the external seam at its interface. Don't expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

## Testing strategy: replace, don't layer

- Write the new tests at the deepened module's interface **first**. The **interface is the test surface**.
- Only once those exist and pass do the old unit tests on the shallow modules become waste. Then delete them. **Replacement is what licenses the deletion, and the order is the proof**. A test removed before its replacement passes is a test removed to make the build green, which is a different act with the same diff.
- Before deleting one, name the behaviour it covered and point at the new test that covers it. A behaviour with no successor is not waste; it is coverage you are about to lose, and it belongs in the deepened module's tests or in `coverageGaps`.
- Where the repo validates its suite by mutation (breaking one invariant at a time and checking the suite catches it), add the mutation for the new interface in the same change. A test at a new seam that has never failed is not yet a test.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors, since they describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.
